Refactoring ACL2
================

This is Jared's attempt to refactor ACL2's code into something he understands.

It is NOT an ACL2 release or, for that matter, even a development version of ACL2.

It is NOT sanctioned in any way by the authors of ACL2 and has not been reviewed by the authors of ACL2.

Jared may have introduced bugs, even soundness bugs, and is solely responsible for any such errors.

In short: this is experimental software.  Do not rely this program for anything that matters for anything!
