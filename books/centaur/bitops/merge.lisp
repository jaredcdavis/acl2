  :short "Efficient operations for concatenating fixed-sized bit vectors."

  :long "<p>We now introduce many operations that concatenate together bit
vectors of some fixed size to create a new, merged bit vector.  For example,
@(see merge-4-u8s) joins together four 8-bit vectors into a 32-bit result.</p>

<p>In general, the function @(see logapp) is a more flexible alternative to the
operations below&mdash;it can be used to merge bit vectors of different sizes.
However, since it can only merge two bit-vectors at a time, using @('logapp')
directly can become quite tedious when you have a lot of vectors to merge.  For
instance, these merging operations may be especially useful for describing SIMD
style operations, byte swapping operations, and so forth.</p>

<p>Each of our merging operations is logically simple.  However, we go to some
lengths to make them execute more efficiently.  This is accomplished by
providing ample @(see acl2::type-spec) declarations and arranging the order of
operations to use fixnums for as long as possible.  This provides significant
speedups, for instance:</p>

@({
    ;; logic mode version: 11.112 seconds
    ;; exec mode version:   1.404 seconds
    (let ((a7 1)
          (a6 2)
          (a5 3)
          (a4 4)
          (a3 5)
          (a2 6)
          (a1 7)
          (a0 8))
      (time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000000 do
                  (merge-8-u8s a7 a6 a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 a0))))
})

<p>Note that when designing these functions, we typically assume that fixnums
are large enough to hold 56-bit results.  Our definitions should therefore
perform well on 64-bit Lisps including at least CCL and SBCL.</p>

<p>We prove that each merge produces a result of the correct size (expressed as
a theorem about @(see unsigned-byte-p)), and that it has a @(see nat-equiv)
@(see acl2::congruence) for each of its arguments.</p>")
