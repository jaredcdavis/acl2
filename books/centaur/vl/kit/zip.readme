                                VL ZIP README

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use VL's "zip" tool to parse a Verilog/SystemVerilog design and then
write it out into a .vlzip file.

This file is a complete snapshot of what VL has parsed and also includes the
raw files that it has loaded.

These files are typically used by the VL module browser.  They can also be
conveniently reloaded into ACL2 sessions using vl-read-zip, which requires very
little of VL to be loaded.
