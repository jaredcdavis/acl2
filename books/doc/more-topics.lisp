  :long "<p>If you just want to get a copy of the ACL2+Books manual for local
viewing, you probably <b>don't need to build it yourself</b> because you can
just <a href='download/'>download</a> a copy.</p>


<h4>Quick Instructions</h4>

<p>This should work on CCL on Linux and Mac OS X.  It <b>may not work</b> for
other OS/Lisp combinations.  In particular, building the manual requires some
features from @(see oslib) and @(see quicklisp) that may not be available on
other systems; see <a href='https://github.com/acl2/acl2/issues/189'>Issue
189</a>.</p>

<p>You need a copy of <b>ACL2(h)</b>.  Then, just run:</p>

@({
    cd acl2-sources/books
    make manual ACL2=my-acl2h
})

<p>The resulting manual may be found in:</p>

@({
    acl2-sources/books/doc/manual/index.html
})

<p>For more detailed instructions, see @(see books-certification).</p>

<h4>Other Manuals</h4>

<p>See @(see acl2::acl2-doc) for details about how to build your own
Emacs-based manual.</p>

<p>See @(see xdoc::save) for general information about how to build and
distribute custom XDOC manuals.  For instance, you can build manuals that are
extended to cover proprietary libraries.</p>")

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function'>Boolean
functions</a> are widely useful throughout mathematical logic, computer
science, and computer engineering.  In formal verification, they are especially
interesting because many high-capacity, fully automatic techniques are known
for analyzing, comparing, and simplifying them; for instance, see <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram'>binary decision
diagrams</a> (bdds), <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem'>SAT
solvers</a>, <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And-inverter_graph'>and-inverter
graphs</a> (aigs), <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking'>model
checking</a>, <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_equivalence_checking'>equivalence
checking</a>, and so forth.</p>

<h3>Libraries for Boolean Functions</h3>

<p>We have developed some libraries for working with Boolean functions, for
instance:</p>

<ul>

<li>@(see satlink) provides a representation of <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form'>conjunctive normal
form</a> formulas and a way to call SAT solvers from ACL2 and trust their
results.</li>

<li>Libraries like @(see aig) and @(see ubdds) provide @(see hons)-based AIG and
BDD packages.</li>

<li>@(see aignet) provides a more efficient, @(see stobj)-based AIG
representation similar to that used by <a
href='http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/'>ABC</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These libraries are important groundwork for the @(see gl) framework for
bit-blasting ACL2 theorems, and may be of interest to anyone who is trying to
develop new, automatic tools or proof techniques.</p>

<h3>Libraries for Four-Valued Logic</h3>

<p>Being able to process large-scale Boolean functions is especially important
in @(see hardware-verification).  But actually, here, to model certain circuits
and to implement certain algorithms, it can be useful to go beyond Boolean
functions and consider a richer logic.</p>

<p>You might call Boolean functions or Boolean logic a two-valued logic, since
there are just two values (true and false) that any variable can take.  It is
often useful to add a third value, usually called X, to represent an
\"unknown\" value.  In some systems, a fourth value, Z, is added to represent
an undriven wire.  For more on this, see @(see why-4v-logic).</p>

<p>We have developed two libraries to support working in four-valued logic.  Of
these, the @(see 4v) library is somewhat higher level and is generally simpler
and more convenient to work with.  It serves as the basis of the @(see esim)
hardware simulator.  Meanwhile, the @(see faig) library is a bit lower-level
and does not enjoy the very nice @(see 4v-monotonicity) property of @(see
4v-sexprs).  On the other hand, @(see faig)s are closer to @(see aig)s, and can
be useful for loading expressions into @(see aignet) or @(see satlink).</p>
