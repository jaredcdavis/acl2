  :long "<p>These operations model 64-bit signed integer instructions, i.e.,
they operate on @(see i64) objects.</p>

<p>In the logic, each operation fixes its inputs with @(see i64-fix).  Note
that this means all of these operations follows the @(see fty::fty-discipline)
for 64-bit integers.  For execution performance, each operation is an inlined,
guard-verified function that avoids this fixing with @(see mbe).  But most
Common Lisp systems don't provide full 64-bit fixnums, so these operations may
still not be especially efficient: they may create bignums and may require
using bignum operations.</p>

<p>The arithmetic and logical operations (add, multiply, bitwise and, etc.)
return 64-bit signed integer results, with overflow being truncated using 2's
complement arithmetic as you would expect.</p>

<p>For comparison operators (equality, less than, ...) we return a @(see bitp),
i.e., 1 for true or 0 for false.  We considered instead using -1 for true and 0
for false, which in some cases might work more nicely with bitwise arithmetic
operations, but so far we haven't had a good reason to do it that way.</p>")

  :long "<p>Our ACL2 specification is based on the @(see truncate) function,
which per the ACL2 documentation rounds towards zero.</p>

<p>There are two tricky cases here.</p>

<p>First is the obvious possibility of division by 0.  In our semantics,
division by 0 returns 0.</p>

<p>Second is the more subtle boundary case where @('a') is the smallest (``most
negative'') integer and @('b') is -1.  Normally we think of division as
reducing the magnitude of the answer, but of course this doesn't happen when
dividing by 1 or -1.  Unfortunately, this means that @($-2^{63} / -1$) is
@($2^{63}$), which is not a valid 64-bit signed!  We explicitly define
@($-2^{63} / -1$) as @($-2^{63}$), which is arguably the most correct thing to
do.</p>

<p>Some illustrative examples:</p>

@(def i64sdiv-examples)

<p><b>C compatibility notes</b>.  C99 and C11 both say that dividing by 0 is
undefined.  The C99 standard doesn't address the second boundary case, but the
C11 standard clarifies that it is also undefined: ``if the quotient @('a/b') is
representable ...; otherwise the behavior of both @('a/b') and @('a%b') is
undefined.''  So, to safely implement @('i64div') in C, you will need to
explicitly check that @('b') is nonzero and that either @('b') is not -1 or
@('a') is not @($-2^{63}$).</p>

<p><b>LLVM compatibility notes</b>.  The LLVM language reference manual (at
least for LLVM 3.8) explains that division by zero is undefined and that
overflow is also undefined.  A proper LLVM implementation therefore requires
explicit checking that we are not dividing @($-2^{63}$) by @($-1$).</p>"

; BOZO remainder -- prove correctness with respect to C spec

; BOZO shift operations.  E1 << E2 or E1 >> E2
;
;   If the value of the E2 is negative OR is greater than or equal to the width
;   of the promoted E1, the behavior is undefined.
;
; For E1 << E2:
;
;   If E1 is unsigned, the value of the result is E1 * 2^E2, reduced modulo one
;   more than the maximum representable value ni this type.
;
;   If E1 is signed and nonnegative, and if E1 * 2^E2 is representable, then it
;   is the resulting value.  Otherwise the behavior is undefined.
;
; For E1 >> E2:
;
;   If E1 is unsigned or signed and nonnegative, then the value is the integral
;   part of the uqotient E1 / 2^E2.
;
;   If E1 is signed and negative, the resulting value is implementation
;   defined.
;
; Per http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html,
; Clang and GCC accept -fwrapv, which requires signed integer overflow as
; defined except for dividing INT_MIN by -1.

; Wraparound with signed integer operations is apparently undefined in C.

; C standard 6.2.6.2 Integer Types
;  Unsigned integer types have value bits and padding bits (or no padding bits)
;  Signed integer types have value bits, padding bits, sign bit (maybe no padding bits)
;   Each value bit has the same value as the same bit in the corresponding unsigned type
;   Sign bit is zero means it doesn't affect the value
;   Sign bit is one can either be sign/magnitude, twos complement, or one complement
; Negative zeroes, if supported, can only be generated by certain operators, blah.
;   Behavior of &, |, etc., with operands that would produce negative zeroes, is undefined!
; Precision: width of the number not including sign bit
; Width: number of value bits plus the sign bit
;
; 6.3.1 Arithmetic Operands
;  integer conversion ranks
;  integer promotions
;    if the value can be represented by the new type, it is unchanged
;    else if the new type is unsigned, it is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting
;       one more than the maximum value tha tcan be represented in the new type
;    else if the new type is signed, it is implementation defined
;
; so basically converting unsigneds that are too large into signed values is
; completely implementation defined.

;    ... many other options ...
;
; "visibility style"-- somehow different than linkage
;
; thread_local variables 
;
; structure definitions:
;    %mytype = type { i32, i32, %mytype*, ... }
;
; global variables -- bunch of rules and stuff
;
; functions --
;  "define"  -- linkage, visibility, dll storage, calling convention, return type, blah blah...
;  "declare" -- all of that but no definition
;
; very interesting "named metadata" stuff could be used to provide debugging
; information like the original names of things in the source code
;
; parameter attributes:
; function return type, and function parameters, can have attributes
;  - zeroext: parameter/retval should be zero-extended if required by the ABI
;  - signext: parameter/retval should be sign-extended if required by the ABI
;  - inreg: compiler should use a register for this one
;  - byval: you should copy this pointer
;  - inalloca: for stack allocation
;  - sret: for first param only, for pointers only, indicates that this
;          param is a struct that is the return value: caller is then
;          responsible for alignment/etc. checking, making *this faster
;  - align <n>: optimizer may assume it is n-bit aligned
;  - noalias, nocapture, ...
;  - returned: this argument is returned, a tail recursion hint
;  - nonnull, ...

; function attributes
;   - inlinehint: you should probably inline this function
;   - alwaysinline: you should definitely inline this function
;   - noinline: you shuold never inline this ever
;   - cold: this is rarely called
;   - minsize: prefer small size over performance when optimizing this
;   - norecurse: this never calls itself directly or indirectly anywhere ever no way
;   - etc. lots of others, including stuff for saying that it is pure, reads no other memory, etc.

; type system
;  first class types can be produced by instructions
;    integers: iN for N up to 2^23 - 1
;      i5 - 5 bit integer; i32 32 bit integer, etc.
;
; LLVM uses 2's complement representation
;
; add: returns result modulo 2^n where n is the width of the result
;   add i32 %a, %b
;   add nuw i32 %a, %b  -- no unsigned wrap: result of the add is poison if unsigned overflow occurs
;   add nsw i32 %a, %b  -- no signed wrap: result of the add is poison if signed overflow occurs
;   add nuw nsw i32 %a, %b  -- result of the add is poison if signed or unsigned overflow occurs
;
; mul: happens to be the same (they say) for unsigned and signed because it's an
;    N bits * N bits -> lower N bits
;
; udiv versus sdiv: unsigned and signed divide, respectively
;     udiv by zero is undefined
;     sdiv by zero is undefined
;     sdiv of int_min by -1 is undefined
;  udiv is an integer quotient so it rounds towards 0
;  sdiv explicitly rounds towards 0, i.e., it should match truncate
;
; urem, srem, etc.
