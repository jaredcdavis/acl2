<ul>
<li>The name of the function to produce.</li>
<li>A list of @(see smallexprs) to be compiled.</li>
</ul>

<p>We then produce an @(see llvmcompiled) structure that contains LLVM assembly
code for a function with a C signature like:</p>

@({
     void myfn (const int64_t* ins, int64_t* outs);
})

<p>That is, the inputs and outputs to the function will simply be arrays of
64-bit integers.  These arrays must be 8-byte aligned and must not overlap.</p>

<p>The input array corresponds to the variables of your expression.  The
particular ordering used can be found in @('llvmcompiled') structure and is
represented as an @(see llvmvmap), which is a fast alist that binds the
variable names to the indices they have been assigned.</p>

<p>The output array corresponds to the expressions that you have provided.
That is, if you compile a list of 22 expressions, then @('outs') will be a
22-element array and its @('i')th element will correspond to the @('i')th
expression.</p>

<h3>Notes and Todo</h3>

<p>BOZO for nicer interfacing and debugging on the C side, we should probably
generate additional source code files, such as name maps for the input/output
arrays.</p>

<p>The compiler is extremely simple and (unfortunately) really bad.  It doesn't
seem like @('opt') is able to do a very good job of reordering branches to
avoid computing nodes that aren't necessary for the current evaluation.  That
is, we essentially compile:</p>

@({
     (if a (f b) (f c))
      -->
     %cond = ... compilation of a ...
     %true = ... compilation of (f b) ...
     %else = ... compilation of (f c) ...
     %ans  = call i64 @narith_ite(%cond, %true, %else)
})

<p>Where @('narith_ite') is an inline function that does an if-then-else.  It
seems that LLVM (at least in the current way we're invoking it) will basically
translate this into x86 assembly that executes both the true and else branches
and then does a conditional move to choose which one is to become the answer.
That's probably really bad if both branches are expensive.</p>")
