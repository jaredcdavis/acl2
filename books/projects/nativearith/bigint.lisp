  :short "Explicit representation of arbitrary precision integers based on
lists of 64-bit integers."

  :long "<p>We now develop a representation of big integers where the value of
an integer is broken across a list of 64-bit blocks.</p>

<h3>Internal Representation</h3>

<p>Taking a low level view, the blocks in our representation are arranged in
lsb-first order.  That is, the least significant 64 bits of a number is found
in the @(see car) of the list.  Any more significant bits are found in the
@(see cdr).</p>

<p>To be able to represent signed number can be represented, we interpret the
final (most significant) block by sign-extending it.  Meanwhile, all less
significant blocks are internally represented as signed 64-bit values, but we
interpret them as unsigned when computing the value of the bigint.  Some basic
examples:</p>

@({
        Representation    Interpretation
     -------------------------------------------
       (5 7 9)            5 + 7*2^64 + 9*2^128
       (5 7 -1)           5 + 7*2^64 + -1*2^128
       (-1 7)             (2^64 - 1) + 7*2^64
})

<p>Our representation is non-canonical.  That is, there are bigints that are
equivalent but not equal.  For example:</p>

@({
       (5 7)
       (5 7 0)
       (5 7 0 0)
})

<h3>Low-Level Logical View</h3>

<p>Typically the underlying representation of bigints should not be exposed or
directly used.  Instead, most bigint operations are defined using the following
very low-level wrappers for accessing and iterating through bigints:</p>

<ul>
<li>@(see bigint->endp) &mdash; are we at the end of the bigint?</li>
<li>@(see bigint->first) &mdash; get the least significant 64 bits.</li>
<li>@(see bigint->rest) &mdash; get the remaining bits beyond the first 64.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is often convenient to make use of these accessors via the @('bigint')
@(see b*) binder; @(see patbind-bigint).</p>

<p>The core function for interpreting a bigint as an ordinary ACL2 integer is
@(see bigint->val).</p>


<h3>Higher Level Operations</h3>

<p>We implement many routines for computing with bigints; see @(see bigops)
for details.</p>")
